# Stock Price Prediction System

This project is dedicated to stock price prediction employing LSTM neural networks. Training data is fetched through an API from `pandas_datareader`, a widely-used source for financial data.

Crucial Aspects in Model Development and Tuning:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Stock price data often comes with complexities like stock splits, which can distort historical stock prices. It's imperative to clean and preprocess the data before model training.

2. **Feature Selection**: Careful selection of features is pivotal for stock price prediction. Typically, a single feature, such as the closing price, is used for prediction. While more intricate models can forecast multiple features, this requires thoughtful consideration.

3. **Model Architecture**: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks are well-suited for time-series data with long dependencies, making them a popular choice for stock price prediction tasks.

> Note: In regression tasks, accuracy is generally not used as a metric; the primary metric is loss.

4. **Model Tuning**: Finding the optimal model architecture is critical. While adding numerous hidden layers or neurons may seem tempting, it can lead to overfitting or overly complex models that struggle to produce valid results over training epochs. It's essential to fine-tune the number of hidden layers, neurons per layer, and activation functions to achieve satisfactory results. Using too few hidden neurons can also lead to underfitting.

5. **Visualization**: Data visualization plays a pivotal role in comprehending the data during cleaning and preprocessing. Visualizing different aspects of the data can provide valuable insights and steer the modeling process effectively.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of employing LSTM networks for stock price prediction, emphasizing the significance of data preparation, feature selection, model architecture, and tuning. It's important to note that stock price prediction is a complex domain, and this project offers a foundational framework for further exploration and enhancement of predictive models.
